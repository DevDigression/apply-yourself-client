# Frontend

### ToDos

<!-- * Make style of company and keywords required -->

* Do a 2 more charts (at least one different)
  <!-- * Fix barchart column titles -->
    <!-- * Change chart color scheme. -> blue? -->

### Design + HTML +CSS

<!-- * Make Add job clickable / all black. -->

<!-- * Change text to sort by "Stages" instead of "Status" -->

<!-- * Hide "Minimum" on NVD3 progression bar -->

<!-- * center "edit" + "remove" above Deadline/Contact and so on
 -->

* Might be fixed: 
- Logging out deletes user from db
- Job not adding on first submit (have to reload)
