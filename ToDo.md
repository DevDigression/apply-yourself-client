# Frontend

### ToDos

* Do a 2 more charts (at least one different).

- Edit form not saving unless keywords edited --> conditional
- Notes not saving (not getting posted to db) ---> conditional logic caused the problem
- Job not adding on first submit (have to reload) - sometimes

* Test it!

### Design + HTML +CSS

* Might be fixed:

- Logging out deletes user from db (Setup testing .env + variables on Heroku)
- Job not adding on first submit (have to reload)
