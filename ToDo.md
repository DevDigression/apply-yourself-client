### ToDos

<!-- * Do a 2 more charts (at least one different). -->

<!-- * Edit form not saving unless keywords edited -->

<!-- - Notes not saving (not getting posted to db) -> conditional logic caused the problem -->

<!-- - Job not adding on first submit (have to reload) - sometimes -->

* Auth/User tests --> error with user id

* Enzyme tests --> working on Single Job

<!-- * Labels for scatter chart -->

<!-- * Add DEMO -->

<!-- * Might be fixed:

- Logging out deletes user from db (Setup testing .env + variables on Heroku)
- Job not adding on first submit (have to reload) -->
